# Alarm_Project
This is a basic Android alarm app that combines some of the positive features from the Apple and Samsung clocks.
In order to create an alarm, press the circle with the plus symbol in the middle of it to go to the Alarm edit
page. From there you can set your alarm. After that, press save and that will take you to the main page. On 
the page, a tab that shows the alarm should appear. If you want to delete it, swipe the alarm to the right 
to access the delete button and press that button. If you want to edit it, press the tab with the alarm 
information, and that will open the edit page.
